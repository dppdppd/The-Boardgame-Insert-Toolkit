- g_b_visualization is now purely for previewing and cannot be exported (accidentally or otherwise)
- components are now colorized for easier debugging of overlaps
- labels
    - New field, "placement" (default "center") specifies where to place the text relative to the compartment. 
        Supported values are "center", "below", "back", "left", "right", "back-wall", "front-wall", "right-wall", "left-wall".
         "center" places the text in the FRONT of the compartment while the others place it on one of the adjacent partitions.
         "-wall" placement places the labels on the wall of the compartment.
    - New field, "offset" (default "[0,0]") specifies the amount to adjust the position of the text, in the x and y directions.
    - New field, "font" (default "Liberation Sans:style=bold") specifies a font to use.
    - The field "rotation" now specifies an angle in degrees and supports any angle.
    - The field "size" now supports (and defaults to) "auto," which attempts to fit the text into its region.
    - When using an array of labels, the labels are no longer read in reverse order and should appear as specified in the array.
- boxes
    - New field "lid_notches" (default "true") specifies whether the box has notches or not.
    - New field "fit_lid_under" (default "true") replaces g_b_fit_lid_underneath and allows per-box specification on whether the box should be printed to allow the lid to fit underneath.
    - New field "lid_hex_radius" (default "4.0") specifies the radius of the honeycomb hexes in the lid.
- components
    - The field "rotation" now respects any value and specifies the rotation of the entire component.
    - The field "type" has been deprecated. All of the functionality has been moved into individual component features.
    - The field "partition_size_adjustment" has been deprecated.
    - New field "padding" (default "[1.0, 1.0]") specifies the size of the partitions between compartments, in the x and y directions.
    - The field "partition_height_adjustment" has been renamed "padding_height_adjust."
    - The global "g_partition_thickness" has been deprecated.
    - The global "g_finger_partition_thickness" has been deprecated.
    - New field "margin" (default "[false,false,false,false]") specifies which sides of the component will have a partition. The sides are [FRONT,BACK,LEFT,RIGHT].
    - New field "cutout_sides" (default "[false,false,false,false]") specifies sides of the compartment to place finger cutouts. Sides are [FRONT,BACK,LEFT,RIGHT]. 
    - New field "shape" (default "square") specifies a geometric shape for the compartments. Supported shapes are "hex", "hex2", "oct", "oct2", "round", "square", "fillet", "fillet2".
    - New field "shape_rotated_90" (default "false") specifies whether the shape should be rotated 90 degrees.
    - New field "shape_vertical" (default "false") specifies whether the shape should be rotated vertically.
    - New field "shear" (default "[0,0]) specifies angles by which to shear the component in the x and y directions.
